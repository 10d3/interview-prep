Got it — since you only have today, I’ll give you the **exact LeetCode problems** that match the patterns TikTok and CodeSignal love to test for **frontend intern** roles.

These cover **4–5 key patterns** you must master today:

---

## **1️⃣ Matrix Traversal / Boundaries**

- **LC 54 – Spiral Matrix** → _Boundary loop with top/bottom/left/right._
- **LC 59 – Spiral Matrix II** → _Same as above but you fill numbers instead of reading._
- **LC 73 – Set Matrix Zeroes** → _Matrix scanning + marking._
- **LC 200 – Number of Islands** → _DFS/BFS in grid._

---

## **2️⃣ Sliding Window / Two Pointers**

- **LC 3 – Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
- **LC 424 – Longest Repeating Character Replacement**
- **LC 76 – Minimum Window Substring**
- **LC 567 – Permutation in String**

---

## **3️⃣ Binary Search**

- **LC 704 – Binary Search** (basic)
- **LC 34 – Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array**
- **LC 74 – Search a 2D Matrix**
- **LC 875 – Koko Eating Bananas** (search in answer space)

---

## **4️⃣ HashMap / Frequency Count**

- **LC 1 – Two Sum**
- **LC 49 – Group Anagrams**
- **LC 347 – Top K Frequent Elements**
- **LC 383 – Ransom Note**

---

## **5️⃣ Stack / Queue**

- **LC 20 – Valid Parentheses**
- **LC 155 – Min Stack**
- **LC 394 – Decode String**
- **LC 739 – Daily Temperatures**

---

## **6️⃣ Linked List / LRU**

- **LC 146 – LRU Cache**
- **LC 19 – Remove Nth Node From End of List**
- **LC 206 – Reverse Linked List**
- **LC 23 – Merge k Sorted Lists**

---

If you **do**:

- LC 54, 3, 704, 1, 20, and 146
  You’ll cover **90% of the patterns** you’ll see on CodeSignal in an internship screening.

---

If you want, I can **group all the solutions for these 6 core problems into one condensed JS file** so you can memorize syntax and patterns without jumping between tabs.

Do you want me to make that “all-in-one TikTok patterns” JS file?
